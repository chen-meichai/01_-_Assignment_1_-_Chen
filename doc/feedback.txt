Assignment 1 Comments:

You could add some extra space to align some code sections. 
For example, on lines 144-146, you could add a space to make the assignment operators show on a column. 
While that is not mandatory, it would help make the code look nicer at places. 
Otherwise, you have identified all parts of the code that did not follow the style (except for a space between the function call to "function" and the parenthesis on line 309), and corrected it appropriately. 
Also, the new code you included follows the style. Your comments are sufficiently informative.

You copied the files from an example for compiling the document and copying the output to the appropriate folders. 
Note that you did not edit them to make them work with your project. 
Also, since you included the options to have the latex pdf compiled to the correct location, the line for moving pdf files becomes unnecessary. 
If you adjust the notebook name on these scripts (the project compiles correctly).
